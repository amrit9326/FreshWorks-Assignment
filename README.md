N-Number of json files in directory
M-Number of array of jsonObjectArray
K-Number of type of JsonObject like if file has employer cricketer striker which is always 1

Total Time complexity O(N*M*1)

NOTE:The max file size can't be set(not sure) in python however we can read the file according to our constraints using fileobject.read(size) method but to avoid the error I didn't write in code.
